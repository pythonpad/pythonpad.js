# Pythonpad.js

**Pythonpad** is a programming environment for tiny Python 3 projects, that can be embedded in web pages. It runs users' Python code with [Brython](https://brython.info) on the web browser, therefore no server-side app is needed to run code in Pythonpad.

It is designed for serving hands-on exercise problems in online introductory programming classes, and comes with a number of educational libraries that can help students learning how to program for the first time.

Pythonpad also supports auto-grading with Python-based grading scripts to give instant feedback to your students. Our in-memory file system allows you to easily investigate the student code as a file from your grader code in a natural, pythonic way.

See an interactive demo and find more information in our [project page](https://pythonpad.github.io).
